PI was made as a project for 3rd TECHNOVISION 2019 held at the School of Computer Engineering, KIIT Deemed to be University, Bhubaneswar. This project was an app with which the users can click an image of some common problems of their locality like potholes on roads, broken electrical wires falling to the ground, injured animals, etc, then the user can write a short note about the problem and on clicking the send button the problem is sent to the nearest responsible authority for the problem. This project was a success in my opinion and it was qualified for the final presentation round.
